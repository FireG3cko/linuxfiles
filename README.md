Backup of important linux stuff, because I seem to have a habit of breaking my linux boxes.
In the event of such a crash (lol), after installing alpine, I'll:
	1. First install git.
	2. Clone my repo.
	3. Run setup.sh as root.
	4. VERY IMPORANT: RUN VISUDO, ADD fg  
	5. Run fg.sh as fg.

In the event that I'm too lazy to upkeep my backup, I'm putting a list of my installed packages here. It should be comprehensive enough to restore my packages from, at least.
